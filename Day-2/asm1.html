    <h1>Low and slow</h1>

    <p>
      This week I am <i>extremely</i> excited about coooking technique called soul
      vide. In <i>sous</i> vide cooking, you submerde the food(usually vacuum sealed in
      plastic) into a wter bath thar is aprecisele set to the target temperature
      you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <i>Cooking for Geeks</i> , Jeff
      Potter describes ir as"ultra-low temperature poaching".
